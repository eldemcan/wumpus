Hunt the Wumpus is an early video game, based on a simple hide and seek format featuring a mysterious monster (the Wumpus) that lurks deep inside a network of rooms.(wiki)\r\n\r\nYou can watch the game from [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAy-uxBZBNQ).\r\n\r\n### Rules of game \r\nThe world contains a Wumpus, a pile of gold,bat and any number of pits. Each of these items is in a square of the grid. No square contains two of these items, some squares contain none of these items, and the items do not move. Goal of the robot is to get to the square with the gold and reach the exit, without running into the Wumpus or a pit. The robot has one arrow with which it can shoot and kill the Wumpus. If agent encounters with a bat, bat teleport agent into a random block. \r\n####Game Board \r\n\r\nGame board has the topology of a Mobius Strip shape which means one edge of the board connected with other edge. \r\n\r\n![Mobius Strip shape ](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/images/eps-gif/MobiusStripArcLength_1000.gif)\r\n\r\n####Game Play\r\n\r\nAgent should move from square to square, i.e. at all times the robot should be either stopped completely in a square, or should be crossing from one square into an adjacent square to the left, right, up, or down from it. There will be physical smells, breezes, or glitter. \r\n\r\nAs agent explore it will encounter 3 types of rooms:\r\n\r\nNormal Rooms - These rooms are empty. \r\nCold Rooms - These indicate a pit is nearby.\r\nSmelly Rooms - These indicate the Wumpus is nearby.\r\n\r\nYou can assume that the world is such that an infinitely smart being can solve the puzzle without guessing.(depending on the perceptions)\r\n\r\n### Deployment\r\nProject run environment \r\n\r\nwindows 7 - javaSE 1.6 \r\nubuntu 12 - javaSE 1.6\r\n\r\n* [import ](http://agile.csc.ncsu.edu/SEMaterials/tutorials/import_export/) the project into eclipse \r\n* setup class includes settings about game like table size bat size please be careful when you set numbers e.g don't put more pit than cave size etc. \r\n* game class is main class of project if you like to play game by yourself switch off AI by changing ai_switch=true variable with false otherwise AI will play game itself and  show output on screen.\r\n\r\nHope enjoy the game !\r\n\r\n###Report\r\nYou can find more details at the report which is hosted at repository.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nif you have any questions please reach me via [my personal page](www.eldemcando.com).","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
